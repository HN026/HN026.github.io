## Hello, I'm Huzaifa Naseer

I'm a Computer Science undergrad at **NIT Srinagar**. I'm all about the intricate details of computer architectures and have a deep interest Reverse Engineering, AI/ML, Computer hardware and Open Source Softwares. I see myself as a tech enthusiast and an avid problem solver, constantly exploring various algorithms and different techniques of optimizations. With my regular contributions to Open-Source Softwares, I combine my curiosity and commitment to make impact in the ever-evolving world of Computer Science. 

## My Tech Stack

Generally, I like to call myself a **God Stack Developer** because I mostly use *C, C++, Rust, Typescript* in my projects and if you can read in between the lines, yes, I'm obsessed with type-based languages. Moreover, you can say I prefer to be humble and low level when it comes to speaking to computers. You can go through my work in recent years [here](/projects).

For the sake of it, Here is the stuff I've worked with
Languages: C, C++, Typescript, Rust, Python
Backend: Express, FastAPI
Databases: MongoDB, Postgresql, Supabase, Firebase
Frontend: Vanilla JS, React, Tailwind.css
